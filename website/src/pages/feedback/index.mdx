			* Create a issue on [the repository](https://github.com/ScratchAddons/ScratchAddons/issues).

			* Send a message on [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/R5NBqwMjNc)
			* Contact one of the contributors on Discord, Twitter, or other methods

			It is discouraged to contact one of the contributors through Scratch due to [the policy that forbids advertising extensions/userscripts](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/post/2907564/).

			By the way, we have <a href='{{< ref "/docs/faq" >}}'>a FAQ page</a> for your usual questions.
